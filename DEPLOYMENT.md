## 🚀 Already Deployed on Vercel

Your site is live! The changes have been pushed to GitHub and should auto-deploy to Vercel.

**Live URL**: Check your Vercel dashboard for the URL (likely `shoreline-global.vercel.app`)

## 📧 Email Setup (Optional - For Production)

The contact form currently logs submissions to the console. To enable real email sending:

### Option 1: Resend (Recommended - Easiest)
```bash
npm install resend
```

1. Sign up at [resend.com](https://resend.com) (free tier: 100 emails/day)
2. Get your API key
3. Add to Vercel environment variables:
   - `RESEND_API_KEY=your_api_key_here`
4. Uncomment the email code in `/app/api/contact/route.ts`

### Option 2: SendGrid
```bash
npm install @sendgrid/mail
```

### Option 3: AWS SES
More complex but cost-effective for scale
